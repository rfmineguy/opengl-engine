# Firefly Engine

Firefly Engine is a personal project for me that was intended to be a small introduction to both opengl and c++. It ended up becomming something much more than that as I was just having to much fun developing it and learning new concepts of c++ to stop! So I created a trello board as a roadmap, and it very quickly grew in size and ambition, which is a good thing considering this is a learning project! There were many basic things in c++ that I didn't know how to do at the start of the project. The main one being understanding the c++ linker, and using libraries to aid my development.
